# blood-and-guts
BlOOD AND GUTS is a MOBA-like workout tracker made using python, using concepts learned in self-study and from code-in-place. 

This is my 2025 code in place final project submission.

It's a standalone program which combines a workout tracker with MOBA inspired progression themes to increase consistency and motivation.
